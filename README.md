# 🚀 AI Disaster Management – Disaster-Response-ML-Project  

## **Overview**  
This project implements an **ETL and Machine Learning Pipeline** to classify tweets into disaster-related categories, assisting emergency responders in real-time. The final model is deployed as a **Flask web application** for easy interaction.  

## **Key Features**  
✅ **ETL Pipeline**: Extracts and cleans real-world disaster data, storing it in a **SQLite database**.  
✅ **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Classifies tweets into **36 different emergency response categories**.  
✅ **Flask Web App**: Provides a real-time interface for users to classify disaster-related tweets.  
✅ **Data Visualization**: Uses **Plotly** for interactive insights on disaster response.
